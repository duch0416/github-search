### `Libraries`

**axios and react-query:**  
for easy and simple data fetching  
**react-table:**  
for Lightweight and extensible data tables   
**styled-components:**  
because I like it  
**typescript:**  
because it makes code easier to read and understand  


### `Next steps`
I would add authorization and more unit tests to the project, the application also requires a better appearance
